# Welcome

Welcome to Thanos Apostolou Blog!

In this hobby blog I will write for various technological topis. Mostly, I will concentrate in Software Engineer, Web Development and Data engineering topics.

I will not support writing comments in this blog, but I will try to post the most important articles in some platform like reddit in order to receive valuable criticism and corrections.
